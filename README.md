# Yeti.css SASS Port

This is a project forked from andyet and converted to use *SASS* instead of *STYLUS*. I made this because I prefer using *SASS* over *STYL* and these styles are pretty nice.

### Usage

Depending on how you want to use it, you can include the pre-compiled version in your project as a *CSS* file or use you own method to add the *SASS* version.

Credits go to @andyet for creating this library. See their page for documentation.
